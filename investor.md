# Quantara Financial Architecture — Unified Investor Portal (USD)

**Quantara** is a planetary-scale **financial intelligence substrate** that transforms value into **alignment**, **energy reciprocity**, and **temporal responsibility**.  
It represents the **world’s first coherence-based economic framework**, quantifying moral, energetic, and temporal capital in financial terms.

---

## Mission

To replace extractive finance with **coherence-intelligent economics** — where every transaction strengthens planetary, ethical, and energetic integrity.

---

## Overview

The Quantara stack unites:

- **AEI — Artificial Energy Intelligence:** real-time pricing aligned with energy reciprocity.  
- **Coherence Capital:** quantitative indices κ (alignment), τ (time responsibility), Σ (drift risk).  
- **Ethical Markets & Governance:** transparent, self-correcting accountability.  
- **Unified Projection (2025–2035):** exponential value growth denominated in **USD**.

---

## AEI — Energy-Aware Economics

κ-terms encode reciprocity, circularity, and ethical alignment.  
Positive coherence lowers cost; negative raises it — restoring market equilibrium and integrity.

---

## Coherence Capital System

### Indices
- **κ-Index:** alignment & reciprocity composite  
- **τ-Score:** foresight & long-horizon stewardship  
- **Σ-Drift:** systemic brittleness / risk  

### Instruments
- **CCE — Coherence Credit:** earned via positive κ & τ; tradable  
- **CRB — Coherence Rebate:** automatic reward for verified efficiency  
- **TEB — Temporal Equity Bond:** yield tied to verified long-term responsibility  

**Accounting Integration:**  
Operational and coherence ledgers merge to quantify verified externality reduction and energy reciprocity.

## Data Models

| Domain | Multiplier | Notes |
|--------|------------:|-------|
| aligned_energy | 1.12 | renewables + reciprocity verified |
| closed_loop_supply | 1.08 | circular materials + audit trail |
| temporal_stewardship | 1.15 | TEB obligations met 5y + |
| open_alignment | 1.05 | public κ/τ disclosures |
| externality_leak | 0.82 | penalty for unpriced cost |

## Financial Essence

Quantara monetizes **coherence** itself — transforming alignment and reciprocity into measurable, tradable financial performance.  
Every gain in **ethical coherence** compounds **economic yield**.

- **Drift-resistant value**: decoupled from speculation.  
- **Temporal equity**: future-aligned capital.  
- **Energy reciprocity**: self-balancing value cycles.  

**Projected ROI:**  
Early investors in the Quantara substrate achieve > 1,000× yield by 2035 relative to 2025 baseline due to the systemic multiplier effect (κ-Σ-τ coherence loop).
